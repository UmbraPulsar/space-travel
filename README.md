### Notes

Tried using flexbox to align text with button group on technologies's page. Still searching for a better technique.

Found a new technique for button shadows. Using the Outline css property on hover.

in need of reformatting and more componentization to improve reusablitiy. This is not clean.

took some creative liberties with respect to button hover and active states. I think it looks better this way than the design.
